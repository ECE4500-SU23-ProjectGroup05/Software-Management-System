## Contributing to the Software Monitoring & Management System

Contributions to our project are highly appreciated and help us improve the Software Monitoring & Management System. If you're interested in contributing, please follow these guidelines for pull requests and code contributions:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking our repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account, allowing you to work on changes independently.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local development environment using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ECE4500-SU23-ProjectGroup05/client_side.git
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your contribution.

```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Replace `your-feature-name` with the new feature you created. 

### Step 4: Make Changes

Make the necessary changes to the code, documentation, or any other relevant files.

### Step 5: Commit and Push

Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message explaining what you've done.

```
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature XYZ"
```

Push the changes to your forked repository.

```
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request

Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to our main repository. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button.

Ensure that you are comparing the correct branches. The base branch should be our main branch (e.g., `main`), and the compare branch should be your feature branch (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).

Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes in the pull request. Explain the problem you're solving or the new feature you're adding.

### Step 7: Code Review and Feedback

Our team will review your pull request and provide feedback if necessary. We may suggest changes or improvements to ensure the quality and compatibility of your contribution.

### Step 8: Merge and Deployment

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into our main repository. Your changes will then become part of the Software Monitoring & Management System. Congratulations on your contribution!
